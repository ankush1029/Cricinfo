    <b>Mohammed Shami Ahmed</b><p>(born 3 September 1990) is an Indian international cricketer who plays for the Indian national cricket team in all formats of the game as a right-arm fast bowler. He plays domestically for Bengal and in the Indian Premier League for Gujarat Titans.

        He is a right-arm fast bowler, who bowls the ball off the seam and using swing, including reverse swing, to move the ball both ways. He has been described as a fine bowler at the end of a limited-overs innings and as "unplayable" at times in all formats.
        
        Shami made his international debut in a One Day International (ODI) against Pakistan in January 2013, bowling four maiden overs. His Test debut in November 2013 saw him take a five-wicket haul against the West Indies. He is the fastest Indian bowler to take 100 ODI wickets. During the 2019 Cricket World Cup, he became the second Indian bowler to claim a hat-trick in a World Cup match. As of 2022 Shami has an A grade central contract from the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI), the second highest grade of contract.</p>
    <h1>Early Life</h1>    
        <p>Shami grew up in the village of Sahaspur in Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, one of five children.[8][9] His father Tauseef Ali[c] was a farmer who had been a fast bowler in his youth;[9][10] when Shami was 15 he was taken to Badruddin Siddique, a cricket coach in Moradabad, a town 22 kilometres (14 mi) from his home.</p>
        <p>Shami worked hard on his technique throughout his time at Moradabad; after matches he would request the used balls so that he could develop the ability to reverse swing the older ball, a skill which would be integral to his success later in his career.[11][12][13] He was not, however, selected for the Uttar Pradesh under-19 side, and later in 2005 Badruddin sent him to Kolkata to increase his chances of selection for a state side.[8] After playing for the Dalhousie Athletic Club he was recommended to Debabrata Das, a former assistant secretary of the Cricket Association of Bengal, who was impressed with Shami's bowling and asked him to join his own club, Town Club. Das took Shami, who had no place to stay in Kolkata, to live with him.[13] After bowling well for Town Club, Das asked one of the Bengal selectors, Sambaran Banerjee, to watch Shami bowl; Banerjee was impressed and selected him for the Bengal under-22 team.</p>
        <p>Shami later joined Mohun Bagan Cricket Club, one of the best sides in Bengal, in order to be considered for selection to the full state side. He bowled to former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly in the Eden Gardens nets; Ganguly recommended him to the state selectors and soon after Shami was picked in the Bengal squad for the 2010–11 Ranji Trophy.</p>

    <h1>Domestic Career</h1>
    <p>Shami took four wickets on his senior debut for Bengal in a Twenty20 match in October 2010.[14] He made his first-class cricket debut the following month against Assam at Eden Gardens, taking three wickets in a high scoring match.[15][16]

        In February 2012 his bowling helped East Zone win their first Duleep Trophy title; he took eight wickets in the match and was described as "outstanding, consistently getting bounce and zip from just short of a good length".[17] He had only played in the match following an injury to Abu Nechim, but it proved to be a significant breakthrough in Shami's career;[18] he had been described as "little-known" before the match,[19] but by April was being touted as a player to watch in the upcoming Indian Premier League season.[18]
        
        He was selected to tour the West Indies with the India A side and "impressed" with his bowling on pitches which were considered to be generally unhelpful to fast bowlers.[20] Shami was considered to have been the "surprise package" of the tour for India A, and impressed the team's coach Lalchand Rajput with his strength and consistency whilst bowling, as well as with his batting;[21] batting tenth in the first unofficial Test match, he scored 27 runs in a partnership of 73 with Cheteshwar Pujara which won the match for India A.[22] Later in the year he was one of only two fast bowlers retained for the India A tour of New Zealand,[23] although he only played in two of the six matches on the tour.</p>
        <p>During the 2012–13 Ranji Trophy, Shami took 11 wickets in a match against Madhya Pradesh in November, including seven wickets for 79 runs (7/79) in the first innings, a return which included a hat-trick.[24][25] The following month he took 4/36 and 6/71 against Hyderabad on a green wicket at Eden Gardens, his second ten-wicket match in only his 15th first-class game.[d][26][27] In the five Ranji Trophy matches he played during the season he took 28 wickets at a bowling average of 21.25 runs per wicket,[6] and in the 18 first-class matches he played before his Test match debut in 2013 he took 71 wickets, an average of four wickets each match.[12]

            Since making his international debut in 2013, Shami has played only occasionally for his state side. He played a limited overs match in March 2017 after not having played any competitive cricket for a period four months,[28] and took part in four Ranji Trophy matches later in 2017, his first for around five years,[29] to develop and maintain his fitness.[30] A single first-class match for Bengal followed in 2018[3]—with the BCCI requesting that he be limited to bowling no more than 15 over in each innings in the match to ensure his fitness for an upcoming Test series.</p>
    <h1>International Career</h1>
    <p>Shami made his Test debut against West Indies in November 2013 in front of his home crowd at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. There, he took his maiden Test wicket – that of Kieran Powell – finishing with figures of 17–2–71–4 in the first innings of the Test match.[51] In the second innings, his figures were 13.1–0–47–5.[51] He had a dream debut, taking nine wickets for 118 runs – the most by an Indian pacer on debut, surpassing Munaf Patel's seven wickets for 97 runs at Mohali in 2006.</p>
    <p>During the 2019–21 ICC World Test Championship, in the 2019 India-West Indies two match test series, Shami took 9 wickets,[62][63] while he took 13 and 5 wickets in the series against South Africa (2019)[64][65][66] and New Zealand (2020)[67][68] respectively. He was included in the playing XI of the first international pink ball Test match organised in India, at Eden Gardens as the second match of the 2019–20 Bangladesh Tour of India, where he took two wickets.[69] During the tour he also reached seventh position in the ICC Men's Player Rankings after taking 7 wickets in the first match,[70] with his 790 rating points being the third-best for an India pace bowler with only Kapil Dev (877) and Jasprit Bumrah (832) having reached a higher rating previously.[71]

        During the 2020–21 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Shami suffered a fracture on his arm while batting against Pat Cummins during the second innings of the first Test. He retired hurt while batting and was ruled out of the rest of the series.[72]
        
        
        The Rose Bowl during the final of 2019–21 WTC ––– Shami was part of that match
        Shami was the joint 10th highest wicket taker in the tournament, along with Jofra Archer, with 40 wickets in total. He was the highest wicket taker among the Indian pacers and the second highest of all Indian bowlers, behind only Ravichandran Ashwin.[73]
        
        He also played in the final of the Test Championship, against New Zealand at The Rose Bowl in Southampton and took 4 wickets, all in the first innings</p> 
    <p>As a result of his performances in domestic matches, Shami was selected for India's One Day international (ODI) series against Pakistan, replacing his Bengali teammate Ashok Dinda and subsequently made his debut in the third ODI of the series in Delhi on 6 January 2013 and he returned figures of 1/23 from 9 overs in a low-scoring game that India won by 10 runs.[86] In October 2013, he was selected in India's squad to face the touring Australians. After being left out of the team for the first three ODI matches, he played in all the remaining matches, taking seven wickets, including two three-wicket hauls[87][88][89][90] and emerged as the fourth leading wicket-taker of the series.[91]

        In India's tour of New Zealand in 2014, Shami took 11 wickets in ODIs at an average of 28.72.[92]
        
        On 5 March 2014, during 2014 Asia Cup, against Afghanistan, Shami became the second fastest Indian to take 50 ODI wickets, reaching the feat in 29 innings.[93] He ended the tournament with 9 wickets at 23.59.[94]
        
        After losing the Test series by 3–1 against England India won the ODI series by 3–1 in which Shami took 8 wickets at 24.16.[94] In 5th ODI he bowled a good spell in the death overs, with tight line and length and middle-stump yorkers. After the match cricket pundits called him the future of Indian bowling.[95]
        
        Shami took 10 wickets at 17.40 against West Indies in October 2014.[96] In the 2nd ODI of the series he got his best bowling figure in ODIs as he picked up 4 wickets for 36 runs in his 9.3 overs.[97]
        
        He was in the 15-man squad for 5 ODIs against Sri Lanka in November 2014, but he was replaced by Dhawal Kulkarni due to a toe injury he suffered during the West Indies series.[98]
        
        For his performances in 2014, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.</p>
        <p>Shami was in the 15-man squad named for the 2015 World Cup and was eventually included in the playing XI. He took 4 wickets for 35 runs from his 9 overs in India's first match against Pakistan, helping India win the match.[100] Against West Indies, he was awarded the Man of the Match after finishing with figures 8–2–35–3.[101] He had a good game in the next as well, against Ireland,[102] finishing with 3/41 from 9 overs. In the last of the league games, against Zimbabwe,[103] he took another 3-wicket haul giving away 48 runs from his 9 overs which included two maidens. India went on to win all the league games. He took a brace against Bangladesh[104] in the quarter final but had a poor game against Australia in the semi-final, which India lost, where he gave away 68 runs off 10 overs without picking a wicket,[105] thus finishing the tournament with 17 wickets at an average of 17.29 and an economy rate of 4.81[106] as the fourth leading wicket-taker.[107] In June, after the conclusion of the tournament, Shami revealed that he bowled through a recurring pain in his left knee. He later underwent a surgery.[108] For his performances in 2015, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.[109]

            Shami returned to the squad for the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy after a two-year hiatus due to a shoulder injury. But due to lack of game time, he did not feature in any of the matches of the tournament.</p>
            Shami made his debut in Twenty20 Internationals (T20I) on 21 March 2014 against Pakistan in the opening match of the 2014 T20 World Cup and took the wicket of Umar Akmal, to give him figures of 1/31 in 4 overs bowled.[134] He played the next two matches,[135][136] but was then dropped for the rest of the tournament.

He was included in the side in 2014 tour of England, following the Test series, in July. He played in the lone match of the series and finished with 3 wickets conceding 38 runs.[137] Shami returned to the squad for 2016 ICC World Twenty20 after spending more than two years recuperating from the shoulder injury, but due to lack of form and game time, he did not feature in any of the matches of the tournament.[138]

2021 T20 World Cup
Although Shami had not performed as well in T20Is as he had in the other two formats, he was picked in the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup for his performances in three consecutive Indian Premier League seasons.[139][140] He was one of the three fast bowlers in the main squad, the other two being Jasprit Bumrah and the white-ball specialist, Bhuvneshwar Kumar. He was the only cricketer from Bengal in the squad.

Discussing the inclusion of Shami in team India's squad, ESPNcricinfo wrote: "Bowling at the death is probably what gave Shami an edge over Deepak Chahar and Shardul Thakur [both in the reserves],[i] who have had greater success up top. Shami has got 14 death-over wickets since IPL 2020, which is the same as Deepak Chahar, Shardul Thakur and Mohammed Siraj combined. He can move the ball both ways, as he's shown ample times in the past, and as a bonus, he has the undefinable ability to be unplayable regardless of format when he gets into his rhythm".[139]

Shami went wicketless in the first two matches of the tournament, before setting career-best figures in consecutive matches against Afghanistan (with the figures of 3/32)[141] and Scotland with 3/15.[142] Shami played every match for India in the tournament.
