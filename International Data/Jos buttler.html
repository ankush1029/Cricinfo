    <b>Joseph Charles Buttler</b><p> MBE (born 8 September 1990) is an English cricketer who is the captain of the England cricket team in limited overs cricket, and plays for the England Test team. In domestic cricket he represents Lancashire, having previously played for Somerset, and has played in multiple Twenty20 leagues, including for Mumbai Indians and Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League. Buttler is known for his highly innovative and aggressive batting style, especially in limited over cricket.

        Buttler made his T20I debut in 2011, his ODI debut in 2012, and his Test debut in 2014. He was the vice-captain and a crucial member of the England team that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, and made the run out during the Super Over which sealed victory in the final.[1] He was appointed captain of England's limited overs teams in June 2022.[2] He captained England to victory at the 2022 T20 World Cup, top-scoring for England at the tournament.[3]
        
        Buttler plays as a right-handed wicket-keeper-batsman. He is England's second-most-capped T20I player behind Eoin Morgan.[4] Along with Adil Rashid, he holds the world record for highest seventh-wicket stand in ODIs: 177 against New Zealand during their 2015 tour of England.[5] He is England's highest run-scorer in T20Is,[6] and is one of only four Englishmen to score a T20I century.[7] As a wicket-keeper, he holds the England ODI record for most dismissals as well as the England T20I record for most dismissals.He is widely regarded around the world as England's greatest ever white ball batsman. During Eoin Morgan's tenure as captain Buttler was his trusted deputy. Captain Morgan would thus constantly refer and consult Buttler for tactical advice and field placements during crucial stages of the game. Once Morgan retired Buttler was named as England's new White-ball Captain after being the side's vice-captain for seven years.</p>
    <h1>Ealry Life</h1>
    <p>Born in Taunton, Somerset, on 8 September 1990,[10] Buttler was educated at King's College, Taunton, where he displayed his early talent in cricket.</p>
    <h1>Domestic Career</h1>
    <p>Buttler played extensively for Somerset's youth teams, appearing at Under-13, Under-15 and Under-17 level.[12] He made his senior club cricket debut for Cheddar before moving to Glastonbury in the 2006 season, aged just 15, taking three catches and 15 runs as wicket-keeper.[13] Later in the same season, he made his first appearance for Somerset Second XI, scoring 71 in the second-innings, and taking six catches in the three-day match against Nottinghamshire Second XI.[14] Playing for King's College, he finished the 2006 season with the school's leading batting average, scoring 447 runs at an average of 49.66.[15] The following season he played regularly for Glastonbury in the West of England Premier League, and for Somerset Under-17s, for whom he scored two centuries; an unbeaten 119 during a two-day match against Surrey Under-17s,[16] and 110 against Sussex Under-17s.[17] He once again led the batting averages for King's College, with his 358 runs coming at 51.14.</p>
    <p>He made his first-class debut for Somerset in September 2009, replacing the injured Justin Langer for the County Championship match against Lancashire, scoring 30 in his only innings.[24] He retained his place in the team for the following Pro40 match against Hampshire, making his List A debut, although he was not required to bat.[25] Selected as part of the Somerset squad for the 2009 Champions League Twenty20, Buttler made his debut in the 20-over format of the game in Somerset's final match of the league stage, remaining six not out at the close of the innings.[26] Buttler again captained King's in 2009, and in the seventeen matches under his leadership they lost only once, and also won the Western School Twenty20 competition.[27] Coupled with his 554 runs for the school at an average of 61.55, and his performances for Somerset, he was named 2010 Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year.</p>
    <h1>International Career</h1>
    <p>Buttler's first taste of international cricket came in July 2008, when he represented England Under-17s in two warm-up matches against New Zealand Under-19s. Batting at number five, he scored a rapid 77 not out in the 50-over contest, hitting 11 fours and two sixes during the 49 deliveries he faced.[64] He also played in the two-day match between the two teams, scoring 45 in the first-innings as the match was drawn.[65]

        In 2009, Buttler played four matches for England Under-18s, two each against Scotland A and Scotland Development XI. He scored 103 not out in the first of these matches,[66] and made starts in each of the following matches, reaching double figures on each occasion, but not scoring higher than 28.[67][68][69] Two months later, Buttler made his England Under-19 debut, appearing in the first T20 against Bangladesh Under-19s. Playing as a specialist batsman, he scored 33 runs off 17 balls as England won by five wickets.[70]
        
        During the 2009–10 English winter, Buttler toured with the England Under-19 team. He joined up with the squad in Bangladesh following Somerset's elimination from the Champions League Twenty20 for the seven-match youth One Day International (ODI) series, playing again as a specialist batsman.[71] He failed to make a significant impact until the final match when he top-scored for England with 42 runs.[72] He remained with the team for the Under-19 World Cup, where he played all but one of England's six matches, keeping wicket in three of them. He scored 91 runs in three innings, with a top-score of 78 against India in the fifth-place play-off semi-final. His batting average of 30.33 ranked him fifth on the England team.</p>
    <p>Buttler was called into the senior England squad for the Twenty20 International (T20I) against the touring Indian team in September 2011.[44] He made his debut for the side in the match as a specialist batsman before going on to play against the touring West Indies side later the same season.[74][75] During the winter of 2011 he was part of the England performance programme for batting and wicket-keeping in India,[76] and played in the England Lions tours of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka,[77] scoring his maiden limited-overs century against Sri Lanka A in January 2012.[78] He played a T20I against India in Kolkata and then toured with England to play Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates in early 2012, making his ODI debut, although he was out second ball without scoring.</p> 
    <p>Buttler's first tournament as captain was the 2022 T20 World Cup. After an opening victory against Afghanistan, a surprise defeat against Ireland and a rained-out game against Australia saw England needing to win their remaining two games to qualify for the next round. In the match against New Zealand, Buttler scored 73 off 47 balls, which helped England seal a crucial victory.[160] In the semi-final, he scored 80 not-out as part of a record opening stand of 170 with Alex Hales (86*), seeing England to a 10-wicket victory and a place in the final.[161] England won the final against 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Pakistan by 5 wickets, with another quickfire score of 26 from 17 balls by Buttler setting them off to a fast start; however, the team was reeling with his dismissal at 45–3, before Ben Stokes saw the team to victory with one over left. With this Buttler became only the second England captain to win a T20 world cup, making him a World cup winning captain.Buttler's role as a captain was particulary the most important in England's victorious world cup campaign as he gave all rounders Sam Curran and Ben Stokes clarity about their roles and instilled confidence in the youngsters which helped them perform to their potential,and he succeded both as a captain and as a batsman in the world cup. Without him England wouldn't have been able to achieve their world cup glory </p>
