    <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <p>Powell was born on 23 July 1993 in Kingston, Jamaica.[2] He grew up in the Bannister area of Old Harbour Bay with his mother Joan Plumar and younger sister; his father abandoned his mother before he was born.[3][4]

        Powell grew up in relative poverty, looking after his sister as his mother worked multiple jobs. He attended Old Harbour High School,[3] also working as a goat-herder for a period of time.[4] He later won a sports scholarship to the University of the West Indies, where he studied geography and social studies</p>
        <h1>Domestic Career</h1>
        <p>Powell made his List A debut in January 2015, playing for the Combined Campuses against Guyana in the 2014–15 Regional Super50.[5] He took 3/20 and scored 31 runs on debut, and was named man of the match.[6] Powell made his first-class debut in the 2015–16 Regional Four Day Competition, playing for Jamaica against Guyana.[7] For the 2015–16 Regional Super50, he returned to the Combined Campuses. In his team's final two matches, he scored twin half-centuries, 71 against the Windward Islands and 63 not out against Guyana.[8][9] He played a key role in Jamaica's march to the final of the 2016-17 Regional Super50. In the semi-final against Trinidad and Tobago, he smashed 95 runs from 45 balls (including 9 sixes and 6 fours), before taking 5-36; these were both career-best List A performances, leading to him being named man-of-the-match.[10] He was then selected by the Jamaica Tallawahs in the 6th round of the 2017 CPL player draft.</p>
        <p>In October 2018, Cricket West Indies (CWI) awarded him a white-ball contract for the 2018–19 season.[12][13] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of Jamaica's squad for the 2019–20 Regional Super50 tournament.[14] He was the leading run-scorer for Jamaica in the tournament, with 412 runs in eight matches.</p>
        <h1>Internatioal Career</h1>
        <p>He made his One Day International (ODI) debut in the second match of the tri-series, against Sri Lanka.[23] He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut for the West Indies against Pakistan on 26 March 2017.[24] In February 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) named Powell as one of the ten players to watch ahead of the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournament.[25] Following the conclusion of the Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournament, the ICC named Powell as the rising star of the West Indies' squad.[26] When the West Indies toured Bangladesh in December 2018, he was named as captain of the ODI squad of West Indies.[1]
