        In February 2022, in the second match against India, He became the first cricketer for the West Indies to play in 100 T20I matches.[6]
        
        On 20 April 2022, Pollard announced retirement from international cricket.[7][8] On 15 November 2022, Pollard announced retirement from IPL after playing for Mumbai Indians for 13 seasons. Now he is appointed as the batting coach for Mumbai Indians.</p>
        <h1>Domestic Career</h1>
        <p>Pollard was born in Tacarigua, Trinidad and Tobago, where he was raised, along with two younger sisters, in a poor home by his single mother. Speaking about it, Pollard reflects "it wasn't ideal getting up and your mum say 'We only have X of money'."[9] After representing Trinidad and Tobago in the 2005 TCL Group West Indies Under-19 Challenge, he was selected as part of the West Indies Under-19 cricket team to tour Pakistan. Pollard top-scored for the West Indies in the first youth One Day International (ODI), scoring 53 runs off 49 balls.[10] Pollard made another half-century in the second match, but didn't manage to make double figures in either of last two games. He was named in the West Indies squad for the 2006 U/19 Cricket World Cup, held in Sri Lanka, where he only managed to make 19–runs in his four innings,[11] though he did manage to take two wickets in a defeat to Australia. He made his first-class debut six months later against Barbados, and marked the occasion with a century. As in the Twenty20, his innings contained a large number of boundaries, with 86 of his 126 runs coming from either fours or sixes.[15] A score of 46 not out on his List A debut ensured that Pollard was in the selector's minds for the upcoming World Cup, and he described it as "a dream come true" when he was selected in the provisional 30-man squad for the tournament.[16] Pollard's "dream run" continued with half-centuries in both four-day and 50-over matches against Guyana, followed by his second first-class century, coming against the Leeward Islands.[17] Against Jamaica, Pollard showed his bowling ability, claiming four wickets in his seven overs to claim his fifth man of the match award in his 15th senior match. Trinidad and Tobago remained unbeaten in the 2006–07 KFC Cup, beating Windward Islands in the final to claim the trophy. Pollard finished as the competition's leading run-scorer, making 261 runs from his seven innings at an average of over 40.[18]

            The 2008–09 West Indies Cricket Board Cup saw an improvement in Pollard's bowling, as he claimed nine wickets in the competition with a bowling average of 14.22.[19] An all-round performance against Jamaica in the semi-finals, in which he took three wickets and made 76, earned Trinidad and Tobago a place in the final, and Pollard Pollard had a successful 2010 Friends Provident t20 for Somerset, helping them to the final of the competition on 14 August 2010. He scored 354 runs during the competition at 32.18 – the second highest Somerset batting average – including two half centuries at a strike rate of 175.24 runs per 100 balls. He also took 29 wickets at 15.10, second among all Somerset's bowlers.[26] He took an impressive catch on the boundary in the semi final against Nottinghamshire,[27] and then scored 22 from seven balls in the final match against Hampshire, including two sixes and a four, before Dominic Cork injured him with a bouncer that required hospital treatment.[28][29]

            On the back of Pollard's domestic performance he was offered a central contract which he turned down because that would force him to be available for West Indies selection all the time and Pollard wanted to play Twenty20 cricket as well. Despite this his good performances meant that he was selected for the West Indies in the ODI and Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka as several high-profile names such as Denesh Ramdin and Ramnaresh Sarwan had been dropped.</p>
            <h1>International Career</h1>
            <p>Pollard was recalled to the West Indies ODI squad for the series against Sri Lanka. The match was rained off after 18.2 overs of the West Indian run-chase with Pollard not required to bat.[31] He retained his place in the squad for the home series against Australia, but after scores of 11 and 0 in the first two matches, he was dropped for the final three.[citation needed]

                Despite his poor form in the previous season's Stanford Twenty20, Pollard was named as part of the initial 32-member Stanford Superstars Twenty20 squad. The squad would provide the starters for the US$20 million winner-takes-all match against England later in the year.[32] After a series of practice matches, Pollard was included in the team for the warm-up match against his Trinidad and Tobago side, where he made 24 runs off 14 balls and claimed the wicket of captain Daren Ganga.[33] He followed this up with a nine-ball 27 against Middlesex, including three consecutive sixes in the last over.[34] In the final, Pollard claimed the wickets of Andrew Flintoff and Luke Wright to help limit England to a total of 99, which Super Stars openers Chris Gayle and Andre Fletcher chased down in 12.4 overs.[35]
                
                After his impressive performance at Indian Premier League for the Mumbai Indians, the West Indian all-rounder was picked in the West Indian squad for 2010 ICC World Twenty20.[citation needed]
                
                In May 2019, Cricket West Indies (CWI) named him as one of ten reserve players in the West Indies' squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.[36][37] In December 2019, during the series against India, Pollard became the fourth batsman for the West Indies to score 1,000 runs in T20I cricket.[38] On March 4, 2020, in the first T20I match against Sri Lanka, Pollard became the first cricketer to play in 500 Twenty20 matches.[39] In the same match, Pollard also scored his 10,000th run in the format.[40]
                
                On 3 March 2021, Kieron Pollard become only the second across T20 format and overall 3rd player after Herschelle Gibbs and Yuvraj Singh to hit 6-sixes in an over[41][42][43]
                
                In September 2021, Pollard was named as the captain of the West Indies' squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.[44]
                
                On 20 April 2022, Kieron Pollard announced his retirement on social media from all formats of international cricket during the 15th season of Indian Premier League.</p>
