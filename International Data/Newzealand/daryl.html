    <b>Daryl Joseph Mitchell</b><p>(born 20 May 1991) is a New Zealand cricketer who plays all formats of the game for the New Zealand national team and represents Canterbury in domestic cricket. He is the son of New Zealand rugby union coach and former player John Mitchell.[1][2]

        After appearing in over 200 domestic matches in New Zealand's domestic cricket system, Mitchell finally made his international debut in 2019.[3] Mitchell is known for his adaptability and went onto cement his reputation of playing any given role assigned to him at international level.[4][5] He nailed his reputation as a bankable finisher especially noted for his ability to finish the games. He had been one of the most impactful players in the Super Smash and renowned for having hit most number of sixes in Super Smash prior to his late entry to international cricket.[6] He is often confused by fans and English cricket pundits as his namesake Daryl Mitchell is also a right-handed batting all-rounder originally from England who has predominantly played for Worcestershire at county level.</p>
        <h1>Early Life</h1>
        <p>He was still pursuing his bachelor's degree in exercise and sports science when he turned up at Northern Districts in 2012 at the age of 20.[3] He is reported to have lived in Australia's Perth for five of his formative years and he even shared the field with some of the Australian cricketers including the likes of Andrew Tye, Marcus Harris and Marcus Stoinis especially through the school and grade ranks in Western Australia.[8][9] In March 2009, Daryl Mitchell, Marcus Stoinis and Justin Langer sat together as team-mates in the changerooms at the WACA celebrating a first-grade premiership for Scarborough. During his three years with Hale in school cricket and two years with Scarborough at club cricket, Mitchell also played for the Western Australia Under 19s, Under 23s and for the Australian Centre of Excellence, which was part of a Futures League T20 competition. Following his impressive showing in Australian third grade level competitions, he received a contract from Northern Districts which he gladly accepted and since became a regular in New Zealand domestic circuit. As a teenager, he and his family moved to Western Australia in 2006 when his father John, got the position of head coach of the Western Force rugby union side.
