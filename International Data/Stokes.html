    <b>Benjamin Andrew Stokes</b><p>(born 4 June 1991) is an English international cricketer who is the captain of the England Test team[2] and plays for the England Twenty20 International (T20I) team.[3] In domestic cricket, he represents Durham and has played in multiple Twenty20 leagues, including the Indian Premier League, playing for Rising Pune Supergiant and Rajasthan Royals.

        Born in New Zealand, Stokes moved to England as a child.[4] He made his T20I debut in 2011, his Test debut in 2013, and played for England's One Day International (ODI) team from 2011 before retiring from the format in July 2022.[5] He was part of the England team that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, top-scoring in England's innings in the final before batting in the tied Super Over, winning the Man of the Match award. He was named the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World in 2019, 2020 and 2023, and won the ICC Award for Best Men's Cricketer and BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award in 2019. He was appointed captain of England's Test team in April 2022.[6] He was part of the England team that won the 2022 T20 World Cup, top-scoring in the final.[7]
        
        An all-rounder, Stokes is a left-handed middle-order batsman and right-arm fast bowler. He holds the Test world record for most runs in an innings at number six, scoring 258 against South Africa during England's 2015-16 tour.[8] In the same Test, he and Jonny Bairstow set the world record for highest sixth-wicket stand in Tests, at 399.[9] In February 2023, he set a new record for the total number of sixes hit in a Test career, surpassing the previous tally of 107 set by his coach at the time, Brendan McCullum.</p>
    <h1>Personal Life</h1>
    <p>Stokes became engaged to Clare Ratcliffe in 2013.[88] They married in East Brent, Somerset in October 2017.[89] They have two children.[90][91][92] Stokes has a tattoo of a family of lions, symbolising his own family, covering his entire back.[93] Stokes has Maori Ngāpuhi heritage, which is also shown in one of his tattoos.[94][95] Stokes and his mother received damages in 2021 from The Sun, who in 2019 had run a front-page story about a family tragedy which was argued to not be in the public interest.</p>
    
        <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <p>Benjamin Andrew Stokes was born on 4 June 1991 in Christchurch, New Zealand, the son of rugby league player and coach Gerard Stokes (known as 'Ged'), and has some Māori ancestry.[11] Stokes moved to England at the age of 12[4] after his father was appointed head coach of Workington Town rugby league club, and grew up in the small West Cumbrian town of Cockermouth, attending Cockermouth School and playing cricket for Cockermouth Cricket Club.[12] He won the North Lancashire & Cumbria Cricket League Premier Division Title with the club as a 15 year old in 2006. His parents subsequently moved back to New Zealand to reside again in Christchurch;[4] Ged Stokes died in New Zealand on 8 December 2020 due to brain cancer.</p>
    <h1>Domestic Career</h1>
    <p>Stokes made his one-day debut for Durham in 2009 at The Oval and managed to take the wicket of the highly experienced batsman Mark Ramprakash with only his third delivery in professional cricket. He played in two youth Tests against Bangladesh U19 during 2009, in which he made a half-century and took a few wickets. He then went on to play in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup, during which he scored a century against the India Under-19 team.

        Stokes made his first-class debut for Durham against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) during the traditional season opener, which for 2010 was taking place at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi. During that match, he bagged a half-century and took one wicket. At the start of the 2010 County Cricket Season, he also made his Championship debut for Durham when he played in a fixture against Essex. He made his maiden first-class century against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge on 13 May 2010. He has also featured for Durham in the Clydesdale Bank 40-over competition. Durham's continuing problems with many players becoming injured at the start of the 2010 season meant that Stokes continued playing in all forms of the game for Durham.[14] Having had a very successful debut season in first-class cricket, he was given a place in the England Performance Programme and travelled to Australia during the 2010–11 Ashes.</p>
    <p>On 6th May 2022, Stokes marked his return to Durham with a record-breaking 161 from 88 balls on day two of the County Championship game against Worcestershire that included him scoring 34 runs runs in a single over. In said over, Stokes hit five consecutive sixes but failed to make clean contact with the final delivery of the over, getting only a one-bounce four causing him to miss out on becoming only the third cricketer in history to score six sixes in an over of first-class cricket. However, the innings still surpassed Paul Collingwood's record for the fastest first-class century by a Durham player and the record for the most sixes hit in a County Championship innings.[19]

        Stokes has been part of the Northern Superchargers squad since the inaugural season of The Hundred in 2021 but has only made two appearances for them so far. Despite missing the entire 2022 season of the competition, he was retained by the Superchargers in 15th February 2023 ahead of the coming season</p> 
        
    <h1>International Career</h1>
    <p>Stokes made his senior England debut in a One Day International (ODI) against Ireland in August 2011. Stokes was caught and bowled by Paul Stirling for just three runs and did not bowl; however, he did take a catch.</p>
    <p>Stokes was selected for the England squad for the 2013–14 Ashes series against Australia. He became the 658th player to represent England at Test level. He made his debut in the 2nd Test and took the wickets of Michael Clarke and Peter Siddle before contributing 1 run in England's first innings. In the second innings, he made 28 runs off 90 balls in England's loss.[30] He was selected in the 3rd Test and took the wicket of Brad Haddin, he then made 18 off 57 deliveries. In Australia's second innings he bowled Michael Clarke and took Steve Smith's wicket. In England's second innings he made his maiden Test century scoring 120 off 195 balls before being caught.[31] In the first innings of the 4th Test he made 14 runs, then managed to get Shane Watson out. In the second innings he hit 19 runs and took the wicket of David Warner in England's loss.[32] Stokes took a career-best 6 wickets for 99 runs in the first innings of the 5th Test, including the major wickets of captain Clarke for 10 and top-scorer for the innings Steve Smith for 115. Stokes top scored for England with 47 runs in the first innings to help England limp to 155 all out. In the second innings he made 32 and finished the series on the losing end of a 5–0 whitewash. Stokes enjoyed a solid series, however, finishing as England's third-highest run scorer with 279 runs and also second-highest wicket taker with 15 wickets. Stokes was the only English batsman to score a hundred in the series. Stokes was praised for his batting efforts on a typical fast and bouncy Waca surface against the hostile fast bowling of Mitchell Johnson at the height of his bowling powers.[33] The Guardian described Stokes's WACA century as "the only welcome positive for the future.</p>
    <p>In the one off T20I against Australia, Stokes took figures of 1–29 as England won by five runs. Stokes played in all five ODIs against Australia, his best performance with the ball coming in the second game of the series where he took figures of 3–60, although England lost the match by 59 runs. During the second ODI match of the series against Australia, Stokes was given out obstructing the field. He became only the sixth batsman to be given out in this manner in an ODI game.[36] While Stokes never took another wicket in the series, his batting did improve. He scored 41 in the fourth ODI which England won by 3 wickets. Although England lost the final ODI to lose the series 3–2, Stokes was one of England's better performers, scoring 42 of their 138 runs.</p> 
    <p>Stokes scored his second ODI century against South Africa in the lead-up to the Champions Trophy, and in the tournament itself his third, against Australia. He was also named as part of the 'Team of the Tournament' at the 2017 Champions Trophy by the ICC.[44]

        He scored 299 runs, including a century at The Oval, and took 7 wickets in a four Test series against South Africa. In a three Test series against West Indies, he scored 228 runs and took 9 wickets. At Headingley, in the second Test, he scored his fourth Test century, and at Lord's in the third, he took a career best 6–22 with the ball.</p>
        <p>
            Faced with an incisive Australian bowling attack and Bradmanesque batting contribution from Steve Smith,[55] Stokes played a pivotal role in enabling England ultimately to draw the 2019 Ashes series 2–2 (although Australia thereby retained the urn). In the third test at Headingley, England appeared to be heading for certain defeat after they were bowled out for 67 in their first innings.[56] Stokes managed to overturn an overnight Australian lead, hitting 11 fours and 8 sixes to win with an unbeaten 135* in a record pursuit of 359.[57] His innings has been described as "one of the greatest innings of all time" and the "greatest ever played by an Englishman".[58][59] Stokes's innings was rated by Wisden as the Greatest hundred of the decade (2010's).[60]

He was named as England's player of the series as he ended the series as England's top run-scorer with 441 runs with 2 hundreds and 2 fifties, while also taking 8 wickets.[61]

"It's the same with success and failure. There's always the momentum thing, but you just have to put whatever happened in the past behind you."

<p>During the 2021 season, the England limited-over squad suffered a COVID outbreak at the end of a limited overs series against Sri Lanka. The whole squad, including the captain Eoin Morgan, had to self-isolate just before a home series against Pakistan.[76] Stokes had not played against Sri Lanka due to injury, leaving him as the most senior player for the Pakistan ODI matches, for which he was named captain.[77] He led the inexperienced team, in which he had almost four times as many ODI appearances as the rest of the team combined,[78] to a nine-wicket victory in the first match.[79] In the next game of the series against Pakistan, Stokes played in his 100th ODI match.[80]

    On 30 July 2021, it was announced that Stokes would take an "indefinite break" from cricket.[81] In October 2021, Stokes was added to England's squad for the 2021–22 Ashes series in Australia.</p>
