<h2>International Career</h2>
<p>Maxwell was picked for the UAE tour of 2016. Head selector John Inverarity said Maxwell was "a versatile and lively off-spinning allrounder and brilliant fieldswoman... Glenn will provide another spin bowler option on the slow, low, turning wickets in the UAE."</p>
<p>Maxwell was picked in Australia's squad to play in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka.[53] During press conference he said that, "I'm very confident I can perform now at this level. "Hopefully I can be that x-factor that Australia needs to win this tournament... That could mean a run out, a brilliant catch, a breakthrough wicket with the ball or big hitting. I'm really embracing that 'x-factor' tag. I don't really have too many doubts, I don't think I'm going to try to back down any time soon either."</p>
<p>Maxwell was picked in the Australian A side to play South Africa, replacing an injured Jon Holland. Selector John Inverarity said when he spoke to Maxwell he "said 'you're the spinner, you're in the hot seat, get on with it', and we hope he responds to that sort of challenge. Glenn is a player of particular interest, a player of great skill and exuberance and enthusiasm. We want him as an allrounder, so we're very keen for him to get opportunity with his spin bowling, and we're putting him in the hot seat here." Maxwell scored 64 and took 2/70</p>
<p>"Maxwell has bowled extremely well, he is getting better and better," said coach Mickey Arthur. "One of the things we've sat down and said is if you want to be the spinning all-rounder you've got to put a huge amount of time into your bowling, because Maxy would always try to bowl the miracle ball and then he'd bowl a leggie, then try a doosra, he just didn't settle on anything. All we've got him in the nets is bowling offspin, offspin, offspin. It's repetition all the time and he's getting better and better at it. He's a very fast learner."</p>
