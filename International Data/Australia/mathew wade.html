<h2>International Career</h2>
<p>Following his success in domestic limited overs cricket, Wade was called up to the Australian team for the first time in October 2011, for a Twenty20 International against South Africa. In February 2012, he made his international breakthrough as a T20I player against India in Sydney, opening the batting and scoring 72 runs from 43 balls to earn the Man of the Match award. </p>
<p>Following that T20I series, Wade was called up to the Australian One Day International team for the 2011–12 Commonwealth Bank Series. He won the Man of the Match award on debut, scoring 67 runs off 69 balls against India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.[20] During the series, he cemented his place as Australia's first choice limited overs wicket-keeper, and usually opened the batting.</p>
<p>Wade was part of the Australian team for the 2011–12 tour of the West Indies as the limited overs wicketkeeper. However, after Test wicketkeeper Brad Haddin returned home before the Test matches because his daughter was ill, Wade was selected to replace him. He made his Test debut on 7 April against the West Indies at Barbados, and scored his maiden Test century (106) in the third Test in Roseau.[21] Wade was then selected ahead of Haddin for Australia's following Test series against South Africa in November 2012,[22] and held his place until the end of the 2012–13 season, encompassing a home series against Sri Lanka, and a tour of India. He scored his second Test century in the third Test against Sri Lanka in Sydney.</p>
<p>However, from the 2013 Ashes series, Wade lost his Test position to Brad Haddin. He retained his position as ODI wicketkeeper for a period of time, but was ultimately left out of the Australian 2015 Cricket World Cup squad for Haddin. However, after the retirement of Brad Haddin at the end of 2014–15, Wade was recalled to the team for the ODI, and T20I series against England in 2015;[23] but, lost the Test wicketkeeping position to Peter Nevill. It was not until November 2016, three and a half years after his previous Test match, that Wade returned to the Test team, recalled ahead of a struggling Nevill, for the third Test against South Africa, and the subsequent home series against Pakistan.</p>
<p>On 13 January 2017, in the first ODI against Pakistan of a 5-match series, Wade scored his maiden ODI century, which came from 100 balls. He reached 100 on the final ball of Australia's innings, and his effort came when Australia was in trouble at 5 for 78 early in the innings. On the second last ball he got 2 runs off of a ball hit to the infield due to a misfield, which allowed him to retain the strike to complete the hundred. Wade was given out LBW earlier in his innings, but the decision was overturned after he asked for a review.</p>
<p>On 16 July 2020, Wade was named in a 26-man preliminary squad of players to begin training ahead of a possible tour to England following the COVID-19 pandemic.[36][37] On 14 August 2020, Cricket Australia confirmed that the fixtures would be taking place, with Wade included in the touring party.[38][39] On 6 December 2020, Wade captained Australia for the first time, leading the side in a T20I match against India at the SCG after Aaron Finch was ruled out due to injury.[3] In August 2021, he was named captain for Australia's five-match T20I series against Bangladesh.[40] Later the same month, Wade was named in Australia's squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.</p>
