    <b>Chris Jordan</b><p> (born 4 October 1988) is a Barbadian-born English cricketer who plays for England in One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket, and previously played for the Test team. In domestic cricket, he represents Surrey, having previously played for Sussex, and has played in multiple Twenty20 leagues, including for Royal Challengers Bangalore, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Punjab Kings and Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.[1]

        Jordan made his ODI debut on 2013, his T20I debut in 2014, and played for the Test team between 2014 and 2015. He was part of the England team that won the 2022 T20 World Cup.[2]
        
        Jordan plays as a right-arm fast-medium bowler. He is England's highest wicket-taker in T20Is.</p>
    <h1>Early Life</h1>
    <p>Jordan and both of his parents were born in Barbados;[4] his maternal grandparents are British citizens. After initially being educated at Combermere School in Bridgetown, Barbados where he studied alongside singer Rihanna,[5] he gained a sporting scholarship to complete his formal education at Dulwich College, in England.</p>
    <h1>Domestic Career</h1>
    <p>Jordan made his 1st XI debut for Surrey versus Middlesex at Lord's in August 2007. He took 2–41 on his first-class debut and in his second match, versus Durham, helped to dismiss the home side by taking 3–42. He received the NBC Denis Compton Award as Surrey's most promising young player in 2007.

        After suffering a stress fracture of the back, Jordan was unable to play in the 2010 English cricket season. He resumed training in December that year.[6]
        
        At the end of the 2012 season, Jordan was released by Surrey after six years with the county.[7] He returned to Barbados to play a second winter season for the Barbados national cricket team, before joining Sussex for the English 2013 season, taking championship best figures of 6–48 on debut against Yorkshire.</p>
    <h1>International Career</h1>
    <p>Qualified to play for both the West Indies and England (through both maternal genealogy and residency), he chose to play for England. He made his ODI debut in September 2013 against Australia, and took his first ODI five-wicket haul against Sri Lanka on 28 May 2014 at Old Trafford, with figures of 5 for 29, helping England to a 10-wicket win.[8]

        Jordan was named in the England Test squad for their series against Sri Lanka,[9] before making his debut in the first Test.
        
        He was also named in the 3rd, 4th and 5th Test matches of India's tour of England in 2014.</p>
        <p>Jordan made his ODI debut against Australia, taking figures of 3–51. Jordan's selection had come as a surprise to many following his injury problems. Jordan played in the first two matches of the return series in Australia, taking 1–50 and 2–53. Jordan played in the final three games of the series, the pick of his figures being 2–37 in the final game of the series. Jordan's economy rate did not pass 6.00 runs per over in any of the games, making him one of England's stand out bowlers.

            Jordan made his T20 debut at the World Cup against New Zealand in a rain affected match. He took 2–28 in the second match against Sri Lanka as England secured an unlikely victory. Jordan played in the defeat against South Africa which ended their hopes of progressing in the competition. He took 1–13 in three overs against the Netherlands but was unable to prevent an embarrassing defeat for England.</p>
            <p>Although Jordan didn't play in the Test series, he returned to the fold for the ODI series. He picked up figures of 1–33 in the first match, as England secured an emphatic victory. However, he was expensive in the next match, taking figures of 1–97 as New Zealand posted 398 to secure a win on the D/L method. Jordan injured himself in the match and was ruled out of the rest of the series, which England went on to win 3–2.

                After being left out of the matches against Australia, Jordan returned against Pakistan. Jordan played in the first T20 against Pakistan, finishing with figures of 0–37. After being rotated in the second match, he returned in the third match of the series and took figures of 3–23, as the scores were tied. Jordan was entrusted to bowl the Super Over and England won the match.</p>
                <p>Jordan was selected for the T20Is series in WI 2019. He played the first T20I in which he had figures of 2-16(3). After this he was considered for selection in England's 2019 Cricket World Cup squad.[11]

                    On 29 May 2020, Jordan was named in a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic.[12][13] On 4 September 2020, in the opening T20I against Australia, Jordan played in his 50th T20I match.[14] On 1 December 2020, in the third match against South Africa, Jordan became the leading wicket-taker for England in T20I cricket, taking his 66th dismissal.[15] In September 2021, Jordan was named in England's squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup.[16] In September 2022, Jordan was named in England's squad for the 2022 T20i world cup. Jordan did not play during the group stage but replaced an injured Mark Wood for the semi final against India, in which he took 3-43, notably bowling three consecutive overs at the death. He then went on to play in the final against Pakistan in which he took 2–27 with England winning the match and tournament.</p>
