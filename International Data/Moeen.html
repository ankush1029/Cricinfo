    <b>Moeen Munr Ali</b><p>Moeen Munir Ali OBE (born 18 June 1987) is an English cricketer who serves as vice-captain for England in limited overs cricket, and previously played for the Test team. In domestic cricket, he represents Warwickshire, having previously played for Worcestershire, and has played in multiple Twenty20 leagues, including for Royal Challengers Bangalore and Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.

        Ali made his debuts in all three formats in 2014, and played for England's Test team until 2021. He was part of the England teams that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup[1] and 2022 T20 World Cup.[2]
        
        Ali plays as an all-rounder, batting left-handed and bowling off spin.</p>
        <h1>Early Life</h1>
        <p>Ali was born in Birmingham.[3] He is of Pakistani and English descent; his grandfather migrated to England from Mirpur, Azad Kashmir,[4][5][6] while his grandmother, Betty Cox, was a white Briton.[7] He can understand Urdu and Punjabi.[8] He became known fondly as ‘the beard that's feared’ while playing for Worcestershire.[9] Ali's father worked as a taxi driver,[10] and as a psychiatric nurse.[7] He grew up on the same street as fellow cricketers Kabir Ali (his first cousin), Naqash Tahir, and Rawait Khan.[7] His brothers Kadeer and Omar are also cricketers.[7] Ali is a keen football fan and a lifelong supporter of Liverpool F.C.</p>
        <h1>Domestic Career</h1>
        <p>Ali signed for Warwickshire aged just 15, hitting a half-century for the county's Second XI a few days before his 16th birthday.[12] After more games at this level in 2004, and a first outing for England Under-19s against their Bangladeshi counterparts he spent the succeeding winter playing for the Under-19s on their tour of India.

            2005 saw Ali make his first-class debut, against Cambridge University in May. He impressed with the bat, making 57 not out in his only innings, and sent down two overs for 15 runs. Playing that summer against Sri Lankan Under-19s, he starred in the final "Test" by making 52 not out and 100 not out (the latter innings from 56 balls) and claiming seven wickets. He was then selected for the 2006 Under-19 Cricket World Cup, which was held in Sri Lanka, and was immediately promoted to captain by coach Andy Pick. He made three half-centuries in the tournament, and took seven wickets.[citation needed]
            
            Ali received additional opportunities for his county in 2006, playing his first List A games. The first of these came against Derbyshire, where he dismissed Steffan Jones to claim his maiden first-team wicket. He also took his first wickets in first-class cricket, and his first three victims were all Test players: Stuart Law, Dominic Cork and Dave Mohammed. With the bat he scored 68 on his County Championship debut against Nottinghamshire, then equalled that score against Durham.
            
            Ali's opportunities were somewhat limited, however, and Alex Loudon took his place in the side. In July 2006, with the expiry of his Warwickshire contract only months away, Ali brushed off rumours of a move to Worcestershire, saying "I don't know anything about it",[13] but in September it was announced that Ali would indeed be leaving to join that county. The player himself said that he had been impressed by Worcestershire and felt it gave him the best prospects of furthering his career.</p>

            <p>He made his debut for Worcestershire in their ten-wicket win over Loughborough UCCE on 25 April 2007.

                Ali's highest first-class score of 250, scored against Glamorgan at New Road, featured a partnership of 219 with Matt Pardoe.[15]
                
                At the end of the 2010 season Worcestershire secured promotion to the first division of the County Championship.[16] After he was overlooked by the England Lions and England Performance Programme at the end of the 2010 English season, Moeen opted to play club cricket in Bangladesh at the suggestion of Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan. Shakib played for Worcestershire as their overseas player in 2010 and the link with the club led to Moeen representing Mohammedan Sporting Club in the Ispahani Premier Division.[17]
                
                2011 season
                During the 2011 season, Moeen spent three weeks as Worcestershire's acting captain while the usual club captain, Daryl Mitchell, was injured. Though he had captained England Under-19s, it was the first time he filled the role for his county. As he was inexperienced, Moeen approached senior players Vikram Solanki and Ben Scott for advice.[18]
                
                Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal was Worcestershire's overseas player for a short time in 2011 and while at the club he encouraged Moeen to try bowling the doosra.[19] Moeen had to wait until July before registering his first century of the season, and his first since September the previous year.[20] His innings of 158 runs from 244 balls against Somerset was in vain as Worcestershire succumbed to an innings defeat.[21] The following month Moeen twice scored a century in the Clydesdale Bank 40 only for Worcestershire to lose, against Sussex and the Netherlands.[22][23] In the first match against Sussex he passed his previous best score of 136 in List A cricket, scoring 158 runs from 92 balls.[22] In Worcestershire's first season back in the first division, Moeen scored 930 runs in the County Championship, making him the club's second-highest run scorer in the competition behind Solanki. Moeen average 33.21 runs per innings and scored a single century.[24] On the back of his performances for Worcestershire, Moeen was included in the 13-man England Development squad which trained in late 2011.</p>
            <h1>International Career</h1>
            <p>Ali was included in the English Squad for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 in Bangladesh.[30] Before the tournament, the squad played the West Indies in a limited overs series, and Ali made his ODI debut against the West Indies on 28 February 2014.[31] He scored 44 runs before being dismissed and took his maiden ODI wicket.[32] In the second match he made ten runs and took figures of 1–11. Ali was again impressive in the third match, making his first half century in a score of 55. He ended up scoring 109 runs and picking up 3 wickets in the three match series. He made his T20 debut in the second match of the T20 series,[31] although he scored just 3 runs and did not bowl.[33]

                Ali was a part of England's 2014 World T20 squad. He managed 49 runs in 4 matches and ending up wicketless.[34]

                Ali was named in the England Test squad for their series against Sri Lanka,[35] before making his debut in the first Test.[36] Ali made a score of 48 in the initial innings but only made 4 in the second. However, in the second Test of the series he made his maiden century in the second innings having started the final day with England on 57 for 5. England lost the match when Jimmy Anderson was caught off the penultimate ball of the match having survived 55 balls.
                
                In the first Test against India, Ali took four wickets in the match, as well as scoring 14 with the bat. In the second match he made scores of 32 and 39, but could not prevent England from losing to go 1–0 down in the series. In the third test against India at the Ageas Bowl, he took his first five wicket haul in test cricket, finishing with 6–67 in India's second innings. He followed this up by taking figures of 4–39 in the fourth test, taking the prized wicket of MS Dhoni. This helped England win the game and take a 2–1 series lead. Ali only played a small part in the final match of the series, making 14 with the bat as England steamrolled India to win the series 3–1. Ali did not play in the first three ODIs against India. However, he was selected for the fourth match of the series and hit a quick fire 67. However, this was not enough to prevent a nine wicket defeat for England. In the final match of the series Ali took 2–34 to help England win their first match of the series.</p>
            <p>In the Test series against South Africa, Ali returned to his place in the lower middle order. He was named as man of the match in the first Test as England won by 241 runs. While his poor batting form continued, he took figures of 4–69 and 3–47 to help England to victory.[56] The second match ended in a draw, with Ali proving less successful with the ball, taking figures of 0–155. England won the third Test by 7 wickets, with Ali taking the wicket of Dean Elgar and finishing with figures of 1–50. In the fourth Test, Ali took figures of 2–104 in South Africa's first innings as the hosts made 475. He made 61 with the bat but England collapsed in their second innings, with Ali making an unbeaten ten.[citation needed] Despite this defeat, England won the series 2–1.

                In the ODI series against South Africa, Ali took 3–43 in the first game as England won by 39 runs on the DL Method. In the next game he made an unbeaten 21 with the bat to help England to a five wicket victory. However, England lost the final three matches of the series, with Ali taking just two wickets and scoring 19 runs as England went from 2–0 up in the series to lose in 3–2. In the T20 match between the two sides, Ali took 2–22, although England lost the game by 3 wickets, while in the second match he took figures of 1–25, but South Africa won in convincing fashion, this time by nine wickets.[citation needed]
                
                In the T20 World Cup, Ali took figures of 1–38 in the opening defeat against the West Indies. He took 2–34 against South Africa and 1–17 against Afghanistan. He also scored a crucial unbeaten 41 against Afghanistan to keep England's hopes of progressing to the semi-finals alive. In that same match he along with David Willey set the record for the highest partnership for the 8th wicket in T20 World Cup history (57*)[57] He took 1–10 against New Zealand as England won by 7 wickets to qualify for the final. However, England lost the final, with Ali being dismissed for a duck and not bowling any of his overs.
                
                Ali was included in the test squad for the series against Sri Lanka. In the second test at Chester-Le-Street, he scored his second Test century. He scored 155 not out, an innings which included 2 sixes, helping England reach a score of 498–9. He took one wicket in the match, as England won by nine wickets.

                In the second Test against Pakistan, he took 2–43 in Pakistan's first innings before taking 3–88 in their second as England won by 330 runs to level the series at 1–1. In the third match he made 63 with the bat in England's first innings as they reached 297. He did not pick up a wicket in Pakistan's second innings but made an unbeaten 86 in England's second innings to help them turn the game around and secure an unlikely victory. In the final match of the series he made 108 in England's first innings but could only manage 2–128 with the ball. Pakistan went on to win the match by ten wickets to level the series at 2–2. In the first ODI, Ali took figures of 1–30 as England won by 44 runs on the D/L Method.

                Ali made 68 in England's first innings of the first Test, and then took figures of 3–75. In the second innings, he made 14 before taking another two wickets</p>
                <p>On 8 September 2020, Ali first captained England in a T20I match against Australia in Southampton.[79] He became the first Asian-origin cricketer to captain England in T20s,[80] and the first Asian-origin cricketer to captain England in any format since Nasser Hussain in 2003.</p>
