Manan's inspiration is his grandfather. Being the grandson of a former India hockey player, it was difficult for Manan to decide, whether he should pick up the cricket bat or hockey stick. He chose the former. It was the encouragement from his grandfather that Manan decided to take up cricket. Manan used to practice at his school, Guru Nanak Public School, Sector 36, Chandigarh. He also studied at Hansraj Public School, Satluj Public School and Bhavan Vidyalaya sector 27, Chandigarh.[citation needed] Manan made it to the India U13 squad for Sharjah Cup in 2004.
