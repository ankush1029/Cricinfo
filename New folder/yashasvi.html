    <p><h2>Early Life</h2>
        Jaiswal was born on 28 December 2001 in Suriyawan, Bhadohi, Uttar Pradesh, as the fourth of six children, to Bhupendra Jaiswal, owner of a small hardware store, and Kanchan Jaiswal, a housewife. At the age of ten, he moved to Dadar, Mumbai, to receive cricket training at Azad Maidan. As Dadar was far away from the Maidan, he relocated to Kalbadevi neighbourhood where he was given accommodation in a dairy shop in return for low-grade work. He was eventually ejected by the shopkeeper as he was unable to provide much help at the shop in between his cricket training. Having no place of his own, Jaiswal stayed in a tent with the groundsmen at the Maidan,[8] where he often slept hungry and sold panipuri to make ends meet.[9]

        After living in tents for three years, Jaiswal's cricketing talent was spotted in December 2013 by Jwala Singh, who ran a cricket academy in Santacruz. Singh took Jaiswal under his wing and provided him a place to stay, before becoming his legal guardian and obtaining his power of attorney.</p>
